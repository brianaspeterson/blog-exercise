Playing around with Chairnerd
===

Chairnerd is built with Webpack. To get it up and running, ensure that you have `node` and `npm` available on your machine, and then run `npm install` from the root. Next, run `node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js` (or `webpack` if you have it installed globally) to build Chairnerd from source. Finally, launch a local server running on `localhost` and serving the root directory to view Chairnerd!
